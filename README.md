-   Install python `poetry` (recommended) or use your preferred virtualenv tool.

-   If using `poetry`, just cd into the repo directory (after cloning it ofcourse) and then run `poetry install`. That's it.

-   To use the `pyvm` cli tool, you have to install it via pip (or use it within the `poetry` shell, which can be activated via `poetry shell`).

-   You can either download the wheel file from the github repo for this project (I'll try to keep the most recent version there), or if you are already using poetry and have followedd the second instruction, you can just run `poetry build` and the wheel file will be created in `dist` folder within the current directory.
